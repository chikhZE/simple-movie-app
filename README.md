# 🎬 Simple Movie App

This is a simple and stylish Android movie app built using Kotlin. It fetches movie data from a third-party API and displays detailed information in a custom-designed activity.

## 🚀 Features

- Movie list with thumbnails and titles
- Custom detail view (not WebView!) showing:
  - Big poster
  - Movie title
  - Description
  - Rating
  - Rank
  - Genre
- Modern UI using `ConstraintLayout` and `ViewBinding`

## ⚠️ API Usage Limit

> **IMPORTANT:** This app uses a free-tier movie API that allows **only 50 requests per month**.  
> For the **current month**, the app **may not work properly** because the **limit has already been reached**.

The limit resets monthly. You can fork the repo and replace the API key with your own to continue using it.
